Ruby Debug Bundle by Eric Fer and Lucas Fais

This bundle provides a few shortcuts for day-by-day core ruby debug.
It's just getting started but it's a pleasure to share even this little with ruby community.

To install it:
	1. $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
	2. $ git clone git://github.com/ericfer/RubyDebug-tmbundle.git
	3. $ mv RubyDebug-tmbundle RubyDebug.tmbundle
